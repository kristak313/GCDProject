Peer Assessment Project for Getting and Cleaning Data

This project contains a script named run_analysis.R that runs against the dataset that is available here:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Download and extract the archive to a folder named obtainingDataProject. You can then execute the run_analysis.R on the dataset.  The output will write to a text file named tidyData.txt.

A codebook is available in the repository and is named codeBook.md.
